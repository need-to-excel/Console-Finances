# Console-Finances

Set up a vaiable called totalMonths which is equal to array length to diplay the number of months. 
Set up a variable netProfitLosses and run for loop to go through the array to calculate total ammount of all transations. 
Set up a variable profitChangeTotal to calculate the profit change and run for loop to calculate the change in profits from months to months. Used this variable to calculate the average profit changes, which I then displayed through the console. 
Set up a variable maxPofitIncrease to calculate the maximum profit increase through the same for loop. Displayed this through the console. 
Set up the maxProfitIncreaseMonth variable to display the month [index + 1][0] to display the months for the maximum profit increase. 
Set up the maxProfitDecrease to calculate the maximum profit decrease through a new loop. Displayed this through the console. 
Set up the maxProfitDecreaseeMonth variable to display the month [index + 1][0] to display the months for the maximum profit increase.
